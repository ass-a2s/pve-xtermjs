xterm.js webclient and helper utility
=====================================

This repository contains the client and helper utility to use
xterm.js (https://xtermjs.org) for Proxmox VE.

To be able to relay between the gui and a shell program/console,
we need a tool (called termproxy) to open a port (where our websocketproxy
connects to) and to open a pty and execute a program

From Client to Server it implements a simple packet-based protocol:
(everything is a string)

* Normal Message
    0:LENGTH:MSG
    where LENGTH is the bytelength of the msg

* Resize Message
    1:COLS:ROWS:
    where COLS is the number of columns the client wants to resize to,
    and ROWS the number of rows, respectively

* Ping Message
    2
    used to keep the connection between client and server alive
    (we have a timeout of 5 minutes)

every other input from the client will be ignored

From server to client, the data will simply sent, without any
format
